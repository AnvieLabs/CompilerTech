# CompilerTech Docs

## [Grammar](Grammar.md)

DOC : [Grammar](Grammar.md)

I'm building the grammar from ground up. Not using the already existing C grammars.
The whole purpose of CompilerTech is to be from scratch. I just want the Mc (Modern C)
compiler to be backwards compatible with C, with a few extra features, like

- modern comptime code generation features support,
- type safety,
- function and operator overloading,

and on the top of it, have features of any modern language like 

- a standard library,
- a package manager,
- a build system,
- built-in cross platform compilation support

I'm really comfortable when I program in C.
